/*this needs to be manually added into the package json that we have made
post install script is a special script that will allow us to run 2 servers

build script - goes into the react app (client) and then do the npm i, and then allows npm run build to access all of the minified
files, then it will cd out of the file

deploy cp is coping everything in the client.build folder and putting it in the public file(heroku)

after we copied and pasted above, go to the client package json and then add under PRIVATE

"proxy": "http://localhost:3001"*/
